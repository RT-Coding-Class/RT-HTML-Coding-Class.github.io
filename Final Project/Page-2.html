    <p>Jarrin and I met in December 2016 over Twitter (though mutual friends). We exchanged gif and memes, and within a few weeks had started dating. He was in Florida, and I was in Idaho, so most of our relationship was long-distance. However, in July 2017, he came out to visit for our friends' wedding. After those 2 weeks spent together, we knew we never wanted to be apart ever again. So, after 3 long months, I flew down to Florida to visit.</p>
    <p>Jarrin proposed on Christmas Eve! It was so romantic, and I happily said yes. Three months later, I was back down in Florida, though this time it was to help move Jarrin back to Idaho. We took a week long road-trip and visited family and friends all along the way. After that, we were just waiting for the wedding!</p>
    <p>On July 27th, 2018, Jarrin and I got married in the Idaho Falls LDS Temple. It was the best day ever! And we've been inseperable ever since.</p>
