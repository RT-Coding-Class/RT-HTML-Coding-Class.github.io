            <summary>My Childhood</summary>
            <p>I was born in Utah to two loving parents. I was a bright, happy child who loved music and spunky colors. When I was 9, my parents divorced, and my mom, sister, and I moved to Idaho. At first, I had a hard time with the move. However, I came to love Idaho and all its natural beauty. I have lived here for 16 years and I love it!</p>
