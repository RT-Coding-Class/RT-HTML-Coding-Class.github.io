        <img src = "Images/Luna-on-chest.jpg" style = "width:40%" alt = "Luna, a tiny black cat, standing on Rebekah's chest without a care in the world. Rebekah is not amused or comfortable.">

    <p>Luna is my ESA, or Emotional Support Animal. We adopted her in 2019! She was so tiny when we first got her from the shelter. But she was sassy and loved us dearly.</P>

        <img src = "Images/Luna-and-Brownie.jpg" style = "width:40%" alt = "Luna and Brownie sitting on a couch. Luna is on the back of the couch, facing the camera. Brownie, a black dauchund, is sitting on the main part of the couch. She is also looking at the camera.">

    <p>This is Luna, just over a year later. She has grown quite a bit, and now has a full coat! At first, she didn't like my sister's dog. She still doesn't, but mostly tolerates her now.</p>
